# SimpleLanguage

A simple demonstration language built using Truffle for the GraalVM.

SimpleLanguage is heavily documented to explain the how and why of writing a
Truffle language. A good way to read this documentation is to generate HTML of
the JavaDoc comments with `mvn compile javadoc:aggregate` and read that,
and then read the source alongside the comments.

This repository is licensed under the permissive UPL licence. Fork it to begin
your own Truffle language.
